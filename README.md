# DNS registrar for ENS

This project implements a registrar for ENS that grants ENS domains to anyone who can prove ownership of the corresponding domain in DNS; it uses the [DNSSEC Oracle](https://github.com/Arachnid/dnssec-oracle) to prove this.

For details on how to use this, see [How to claim your DNS domain in ENS](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/how-to-claim-your-dns-domain-on-ens-e600ef2d92ca).
